# Giggle - Enhancing Concentration and Practical Thinking: Interactive Education Platform for Dyscalculia Students

## Introduction

Some students struggle in school with numbers and signs, which makes it hard for them to work with abstract concepts or do mental math.Dyscalculia is the term used to describe this group of difficulties affecting the comprehension and application of fundamental mathematics. People who have this kind of learning disability have trouble understanding numbers, measuring sets without counting, completing basic numerical operations and basic math concepts.Not correcting dyscalculia can significantly hinder a student's progress in math, which is foundational to many academic and professional fields.

Dyscalculia has three subtypes:

- Procedural dyscalculia : involves difficulties with the steps and processes required to solve mathematical problems.
- Verbal dyscalculia : the inability to understand and use mathematical language.
- Semantic dyscalculia: involves difficulties with the understanding of numerical concepts and the relationships between numbers.

This system is to be made for Sri Lankan students from age 9 to 10 who are healthy without any disability or abnormality but dysfunction of the neural connections that process numeric language using English Language. The main purpose is to make the student’s math phobia and make the mindset that learning math is interesting and fun for the students who are having dyscalculia. To assist the kids in improving, a novel strategy is being used through adaptive question generation, voice recognition & pronunciation detection, problem-solving simulation, and real-time emotion & facial expressions detection.

Initially, for the dyscalculia students a math skill assessment (aptitude exam) is carried out. This is to provide a baseline for tracking the student’s current level in math and to identify the strengths and the weaknesses.The system helps the students with math by focusing on how students listen to and speak math words and instructions.This provides interactive lessons, building confidence in students to express their thoughts accurately.Then the system helps students with procedural dyscalculia by focusing on how they understand and carry out mathematical procedures ensuring that the students adhere to proper mathematical methods.Moreover, the system focuses on helping students with semantic dyscalculia to understand numerical concepts and the relationships between numbers.
